# AppLovin MAX SDK

## Overview
MAX is AppLovin's in-app monetization solution.

MAX offers advertisers equal opportunity to bid simultaneously on each impression in a publisherâ€™s inventory via a single unified auction to drive the highest possible yield. You can read more about it [here](https://www.applovin.com/max-header-bidding).

Please check out our [documentation](https://dash.applovin.com/documentation/mediation/ios/getting-started) to get started on integrating and enabling mediated networks using our guides.

## Getting Started
### Install the SDK
1. Start a Terminal window in the folder you want to use: `DemoApp-ObjC` or `DemoApp-Swift`.
2. Get the latest SDK using CocoaPods with the command:
```
pod install
```

### Set up the project
3. Open up the `xcworkspace` that was created with Xcode and select the project file.
4. Navigate to the `Info` page, and change the value of `AppLovinSdkKey` to your SDK key. 
5. Navigate to the `Signing & Capabilities` page, and change the `Bundle Identifier` to your app's bundle identifier. 

### Set ad unit identifiers

6. Go through the view controllers you want to test and change the `adUnitIdentifier` of the ad object to your ad unit id.

Now you're ready to run the app and see what ads look like.
