# AppLovin MAX SDK

## Overview
MAX is AppLovin's in-app monetization solution.

MAX offers advertisers equal opportunity to bid simultaneously on each impression in a publisherâ€™s inventory via a single unified auction to drive the highest possible yield. You can read more about it [here](https://www.applovin.com/max-header-bidding).

Please check out our [documentation](https://dash.applovin.com/documentation/mediation/ios/getting-started) to get started on integrating and enabling mediated networks using our guides.

## Demo Apps
To get started with the demo apps, follow the instructions below:

1. Open a Terminal window in the directory of the desired project: `DemoApp-ObjC` or `DemoApp-Swift`.
2. Install the latest latest SDK using CocoaPods using `pod install`.
3. Open the newly generated Xcode workspace file using `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME.xcworkspace`.
4. Update the `AppLovinSdkKey` value in the `Info.plist` file with your Applovin SDK key associated with your account.
5. Update the bundle identifier with your own unique identifier associated with the application you will create in the MAX dashboard.
6. Update the unique ad unit id value within the view controller code. Each ad format will correspond to a unique MAX ad unit ID you created in the Applovin dashboard.
